I have added LightRay, MyVector, Scene, Sphere, Viewer and Wall classes and the Object trait. The LightRay, MyVector, Sphere and Wall classes and the Object trait are mostly complete. I might implement a reflectRay method to all Objects at some point. I still need to implement the raytracing algorithm to Scene / viewer classes.

Basic vector calculations apart from cross product have been tested to work correctly. Wall and Sphere intersection methods have been tested to return a point on the surface when an intersection exists and Sphere normal method has been tested to return a vector normal to the sphere at the given position.

I haven't faced any too difficult problems.

I have spent about 10 hours on the project in the last two weeks.

I am slightly behind, because I was supposed to have a somewhat working raytracing algorith at this point.


30.03.

I have added an object that stores all the necessary constants in the same place. I have done the main ray tracing algorithm that calculates the color value of each pixel. I also added basic functionality to RaytracerApp.scala to show the render on screen. I also added a new class called MyColor that helps with color calculations. Rendering a 500x500 scene with 350 samples per pixel and reflection depth of 5 takes now about 140s.

I haven't added any tests for the new functionality yet but the renders look right so there shouldn't be any large mistakes.

There's been two problems which I haven't been able to solve yet. The renders look way too dim when the light source is small. This could possibly be fixed by allowing points to reflect / emmit a larger color value than the current maximum of 255 of each red, green and blue. I also haven't been able to add parallel threads efficiently. Every way I have added paralellism to the rendering functions, has increased the rendering time.

I have spent about 10 hours on the project in the last two weeks.

I am behind schedule due to having a lot less time to spend on the project than expected.


13.04.

I have added an object FileIO that returns the scene given by the scene file. I also added MyIterator which is a regular iterator that can also return the current iterator value without side effects. I use it in FileIO to make the implementation cleaner. I changed the implementation of objects to not require color, smoothness etc. when creating them and instead use setColor etc. methods. I made the tracePath method tail recursive to make it more efficient. 

I haven't completely tested the functionality of FileIO yet but it works correctly with correctly formatted files.

I was able to fix the problem with small light sources not lighting up the scene enough by allowing rays to have a larger color value than 255. I haven't really progressed in trying to make the threads run efficiently in parallel and it's taking me way too much time to troubleshoot it that I decided to not worry about it until I have done all the other required functionality.

I have spent about 15 hours on the project in the last two weeks.

I am slightly behind schedule.
